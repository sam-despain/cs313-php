			<div class="contents">
				<p>Hello. I am Samuel Despain, and I am a resident of sunny Gilbert, Arizona. I have not lived there my whole life, though. I had the privilege of living in different climates in different parts of the world.</p>
				<p>I was born in Provo, Utah, when my parents were students at BYU. During the first part of my childhood, my family had moved around between Arizona, Colorado, and even Spain.</p>
				<p>We settled in Colorado until the end of my freshman year of high school, after which we moved to Arizona where the family currently resides.</p>
