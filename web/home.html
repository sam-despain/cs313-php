			<h2>About me</h2>
			<div class="contents">
				<p>Hello. I am Samuel Despain, and I am a resident of sunny Gilbert, Arizona. I have not lived there my whole life, though. I had the privilege of living in different climates in different parts of the world.</p>
				<p>I was born in Provo, Utah, when my parents were students at BYU. During the first part of my childhood, my family had moved around between Arizona, Colorado, and even Spain.</p>
				<p>We settled in Colorado until the end of my freshman year of high school, after which we moved to Arizona where the family currently resides.</p>
				<p>Mere weeks after graduating high school, I embarked on a full-time proselyting mission. I spent the first twelve weeks in the Arizona Tempe Mission, after which I was called to the Oregon Eugene Mission.</p>
				<p>Upon returning home, I began attending BYU-Idaho. A couple of years into college, I began dating a lovely, virtuous young woman named Edith. When I proposed to her, she agreed to be my bride.</p>
